Text Generation with Markov Chains

# Task-3: Text Generation with Markov Chains

In this task, I implemented a simple text generation model using **Markov Chains**, a probabilistic method that predicts the next word or character based on previous ones. This classic approach to Natural Language Processing helped me understand the statistical modeling of text before the deep learning era.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Build a text generator using Markov chain principles
- Learn how transition probabilities drive sequential prediction
- Compare outputs from different n-gram levels (unigram, bigram, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NLTK / Regex (for text preprocessing)

## 📁 Contents
- `markov_text_generator.py` – Python script for training and generating text
- `input_text.txt` – Source dataset for training the model
- `example_output.txt` – Sample text generated using the model

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Place your training text in `input_text.txt`
2. Run `markov_text_generator.py`
3. Generated text will be printed or saved in `example_output.txt`

## 💡 Sample Output
> **Generated Text:**  
> "The sun sets and the silence breaks through. Birds fly beneath the silver horizon where dreams awaken..."

## 📌 Outcome
Developed a functional Markov Chain-based text generator and gained insights into early NLP techniques that laid the foundation for modern language models.
